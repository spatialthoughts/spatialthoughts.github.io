## Optional Components

The template is pre-wired for two optional features that are disabled by default.
Enable either one by following the steps below.

### Adding a Blog with Giscus Comments

Adds a `/blog` section for writing about projects, tutorials, or field notes.
Comments on posts are powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) (GitHub Discussions — free,
no third-party tracking).

**Step 1 — Enable GitHub Discussions in your repo**

Go to your repo on GitHub → Settings → General → Features → check **Discussions**.

**Step 2 — Enable the blog plugin in `mkdocs.yml`**

Open `mkdocs.yml` and uncomment these two lines:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - blog        # <-- uncomment this line

nav:
  ...
  - Blog: blog/index.md    # <-- uncomment this line
```

**Step 3 — Create the blog directory**

Create the folder `docs/blog/` and add a file `docs/blog/.authors.yml`:

```yaml
authors:
  [YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]:
    name: [YOUR NAME]
    description: Author
```

Create your first post at `docs/blog/posts/my-first-post.md`:

```markdown
---
date: 2024-01-01
authors:
  - [YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]
comments: true
---

# My First Post

Content goes here.
```

**Step 4 — Configure Giscus comments**

1. Go to [https://giscus.app](https://giscus.app), fill in your GitHub repo details,
   and copy the generated `<script>` tag.
2. Open `overrides/partials/comments.html`.
3. Replace the placeholder `<script>` tag with your actual one from giscus.app.
4. Remove the `<!--` and `-->` comment markers around the script block.

### Adding Jupyter Notebook Projects

Jupyter notebook support is included by default via `mkdocs-jupyter`. Drop your `.ipynb`
file into `docs/projects/` and add it to the nav in `mkdocs.yml` exactly like any other
page:

```yaml
nav:
  - Projects:
    - "All Projects": projects/index.md
    - "My Notebook Analysis": projects/my-analysis.ipynb
```

Cell outputs (maps, charts, tables) render inline on the published site.
